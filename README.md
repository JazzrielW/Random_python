# Worse Liars

Small python script for calculating the number of "Lies" for a range of numbers used in the prime test of Fermat's little theorem. Gives the result as a csv file that can be easily subjected to nummerical analysis. This was done as a response to this numberphile video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MscGSN5J6o . If you want to modify or *understand* this code at all, I strongly recommend you watch the video first.

This is not the best, or cleanest code you'll find, but it works!
